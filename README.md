üßó Challenges Faced
-null purchase_id problem while generating pdf faced hours of challenge as I could not use purchase_Id to generate pdf
File Path Handling

-Issue: PDF storage path differed between dev/prod environments
Solution: Used @Value("${policy.document.path}") with profile-specific configs

-Text Positioning
Issue: Manual coordinate calculations for text placement
Solution: Created helper methods for consistent line spacing

-Use of transactional
Essential when performing multiple DB operations in a single method (like saving a purchase and updating related data)
used it to basically perform save operation before generating pdf

-initially I thought It would be an easy developement but the problems I faced while generating pdf as I was not using h2 db for In 
memory storage was immense and solving it took time and help.
